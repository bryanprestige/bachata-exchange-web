It is always full of people with a good energy, even if you are a beginner, you would have fun. After last year, I was in such a hype to come back last Sunday and it was amazing, BE never let you down. It is like that special place that when you are there all your problems disappeare and you are able to see life differently. Love it here!! :) thank you to the organisers to make it happen, winter felt really long without BE.",

By far my favorite night of dancing in London, doesn't go late, incredibly accessible off Liverpool Street Station, and the music, community, and vibe are always quality. It's like having a dance festival happen every weekend, and they play all types of bachata. The teachers they bring in are exceptional as well, and accommodate for multiple skill levels. Cannot recommend this spot enough, if you're a bachata dancer, This spot is a must",

If you are a complete beginner or an advance dancer, you will find many friendly people that you will enjoy dancing with.",
